                    <div class="about-text">
            <p>Mental Health Australia is the peak, national non-government organisation representing and promoting the interests of the Australian mental health sector and committed to achieving better mental health for all Australians. It was established in 1997 as the first independent peak body in Australia to represent the full spectrum of mental health stakeholders and issues. Mental Health Australia members include national organisations representing consumers, carers, special needs groups, clinical service providers, professional bodies, public and private mental health service providers, researchers and state/territory community mental health peak bodies.</p>

<p> Mental Health Australia aims to promote mentally healthy communities, educate Australians on mental health issues, influence mental health reform so that government policies address all contemporary mental health issues, conduct research on mental health issues, and carry out regular consultation to represent the best interests of our members, partners and the community. These endeavours in education and policy reform are matched by our commitment to researching more innovative approaches to the provision of mental health care. In addition, Mental Health Australia continues to focus on the human rights of people with a mental illness. </p>

<p> One in five Australians are affected by mental illness annually. We cannot afford to be complacent in our efforts to achieve changes to our mental health care system when we consider the impact of mental ill-health on our community.</p>

        <p>
            Help Mental Health Australia raise awareness of mental health issues by purchasing and wearing a Flannel Flower pin.  The Flannel Flower, an Australian native, is the national symbol for mental health awareness.</p>

<p> Being open and empathetic to a person’s expression of distress can assist in the recovery of a person living with mental illness and change the negative attitudes of our society as a whole.
