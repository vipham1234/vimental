                <h2 class="card-title2">What is mental illness?</h2>
                <p>Mental illness is a general term for a group of illnesses that affect the mind or brain. These illnesses, which include bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, ... affect the way a person thinks, feels and acts. The exact cause of mental illness is unknown. What is known is that mental illness is NOT a character fault, weakness or something inherently ‘wrong’ with a person. It is an illness like any other.</p>

                <p>A GP can provide either treatment or can refer you to a specialist for extra help. Effective treatments are available and early identification and care can reduce harm and improve quality of life. Many general practices can provide a practice nurse to help you with your appointments. You can speak to a practice nurse if you are uncertain or nervous about speaking to a GP.</p>
